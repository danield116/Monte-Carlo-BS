Hello,
Here is the instruction to run the code:
1) Download all CSV files and the plotting_bs.py code,
2) Put the CSV files and the code in the same directory,
3) Change the compiler's directory to the directory with the CSV files and the code,
4) Run the code (it might take a while for the code to plot all the graphs),
5) Close the image tab to display the new ones.
(optional) Use the MAT292_csv_builder.py code to generate your own dataset

Important
The MAT292_csv_builder.py will update your CSV file. 
To reproduce the results in the report, please do NOT run the script.
The reason is that the script will fetch real-time data from yfinance, 
and yfinance can't return expired contracts.

Regards,
Group 39
