Hello,
Here is the instruction to run the code:
Download all CSV files and the plotting_bs.py code
Put the CSV files and the code in the same directory
Change the compiler's directory to the directory with the CSV files and the code
Run the code (it might take a while for the code to plot all the graphs)
(optional) Use the MAT292_csv_builder.py code to generate your own dataset

Important
The MAT292_csv_builder.py will update your CSV file. 
To reproduce the results in the report, please do NOT run the script.
The reason is that the script will fetch real-time data from yfinance, 
and yfinance can't return expired contracts.

Regards,
Group 39
